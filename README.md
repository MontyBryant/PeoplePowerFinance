# PeoplePower — Rebuild 2026

An **experimental prototype** for a **regenerative + gamified investment platform**.

I originally hacked this together in **2019**. With recent developments in **“vibecoding”**, I cleaned it up so it’s easier to publish on GitHub and view via **GitHub Pages**.

## What this repo is
- A **static site prototype** (HTML/CSS/JS + assets) meant for quick iteration and demoing ideas.
- A snapshot of a concept: **investing + impact + game mechanics** in one playful UI.

## View it
- **GitHub Pages**: enable Pages for the repo and publish from the **root** (it serves `index.html`).
- **Locally**: open `index.html` directly, or run a tiny static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes
- This is a **prototype**, not production software.
- Some legacy styling/assets are vendored under `assets/vendor/offset-earth/` to preserve the original look and feel.
