# PeoplePower — Rebuild 2026

An **experimental prototype** for a **regenerative + gamified investment platform**.

I originally hacked this together in **2019**. With recent developments in **“vibecoding”**, I cleaned it up and started hacking on it again...

## What this repo is
- A **static site prototype** (HTML/CSS/JS + assets) meant for quick iteration and demoing ideas.
- A snapshot of a concept: **investing + impact + game mechanics** in one playful UI.

## View it
- **Online**: `https://montybryant.github.io/PeoplePowerFinance/`
- **Locally**: download the repo and open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## High-level features / ideas
- **Impact wallet UI**: a playful “your world” homepage that reflects your impact over time.
- **Clickable eco-assets**: projects like **wind** and **solar** act like portfolio positions with their own modals.
- **Investment concept**: show **amount invested**, **yield/APY**, **earned yield**, and a **Harvest yield** action (prototype).
- **Leaderboard**: compare heroes/villains and jump to profiles.
- **Edit mode**: move on-page assets around to prototype layouts quickly (saved in-browser).
- **Day / night theme**: glassy UI that looks good in both modes.
